## Well, here it is, the first post! 

### I suppose I should introduce myself at this point.

My name is Regina, I am a content designer and social media manager with a demonstrated background working in customer service and technical support in consumer electronics and SaaS products. I am a Senior at the University of Arizona persuing my Bachelor of Arts in Information Science and eSociety with a minor in Communication. As a *restorative* and *analytical* person, I bring excellent critical thinking and problem solving skills to the table, ready to take on multiple projects at once to deliver results for your brand. My background in customer service as well as my educational background have me well prepared to communicate across multiple methods, altering my style of communication based on the audience.

This blog is here as a portfolio of my work experiences and personal projects that relate to the Internet, how people interact with the Internet, and how businesses suceed online. Stay tuned for more content here and you can also follow me on Instagram at @_reginamaxine
